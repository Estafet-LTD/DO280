# DO280
- These are files harvested from the Red Hat DO280 course specific to my cluster.
- They are useful examples to use in the future on other systems.
- They can be used along with my personal files in https://github.com/canpb/redhat-lab
- In addition there are different keys and certs that are only on my local machine here.
